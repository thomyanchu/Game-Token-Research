Executive Summary
The GameFi platform Shrapnel has consistently increased player engagement, reflected in metrics
like follower counts and the trend of NFT ownership. Despite dips in its token's price and trade
volumes, the platform maintains a robust and active user community. The core financial activities, its
token's effectiveness, and its marketplace dynamics all reinforce the platform's appeal. This strong
engagement of players within the ecosystem contributes significantly to Shrapnel's standing as a
leading first-person shooter game in the Web3 GameFi domain.
With its thoughtful tokenomics and well-designed system, SHRAP holds promising potential for
yielding positive returns. Nonetheless, challenges arise with the growing occurrence of cheating and
unfair practices by players looking to profit unduly, which need to be addressed to maintain the
integrity of the gaming experience.
Player Activity and Engagement
● The "Excellent" Twitter score and the dramatic rise in followers suggest that Shrapnel has
gained substantial traction and visibility on social media, particularly in the crypto community.
● The upward trends across Twitter and Discord statistics support this statement, showing a
growing community and increasing engagement.
● The score and statistics indicate that Shrapnel is likely enjoying a strong and potentially
growing reputation in the crypto and gaming spaces. This could positively impact the
platform's economic dynamics and token valuation due to heightened user interest and
participation.
● Even though there is a lack of data on user retention rate, number of active players, and other
key metrics, with our information, Shrapnel has a solid ability to attract and retain players.
Economic Transactions and Token Performance
● Shrapnel's in-game economy is driven by the SHRP token, serving as both a utility and
exchange medium, facilitating player engagement and economic transactions.
● The game's ecosystem promotes real-world value generation. Players can earn SHRP tokens
through gameplay, which can be exchanged for cryptocurrencies or fiat money.

● Overall, the price of SHRAP is volatile. It is characterized by an initial bullish phase with high
volume, followed by corrections, consolidation, and renewed interest.
● The trading volume peaked in December 2023, indicating strong buyer interest at first when the
price increases. The high volume during price decreases may indicate intense selling pressure
or cooling interest in SHARP. The trading volume remains calm and steady during 2024.
● SHRAP has significant trading volumes on Ethereum and Avalanche blockchains, which
indicates decent liquidity, at least on those blockchains.
Marketplace Dynamics
○
● The platform's NFT marketplace has been active, with players buying, selling, and trading
virtual assets that enhance the gaming experience and potentially offer real-world financial
benefits.
● There is a sharp increase in the total number of NFT holders over time, but then stabilizes.
● All blockchains show a steady increase in SHRAP holders, with a particularly notable increase
on the Avalanche blockchain.
● Now is a period with cooling interest from the last boom, not a lot interesting things happening,
and cheater scandals. The price will remain relatively steady or even drop some. However, it is
a good time to buy one as it is relatively cheap. Based on past data, we should expect an
increase in price and interest in the near future.
Tokenomics

● Total Token Supply: At the token genesis event (TGE), 3 billion SHRAP tokens will be created as
the total token supply, and this amount is fixed — it will never increase. No other tradable
tokens will be created or minted beyond this supply.
● Token Distribution:
○ Community Rewards: The largest portion, 33% of the total supply, is allocated to
community rewards.
○ Team and Advisors: 27% of the tokens are reserved for the team and advisors.
○ Seed Token Holders: 20% are distributed to seed token holders, who are likely the early
investors or contributors to the project.
○ Strategic Token Holders: 7% go to strategic token holders, which could include partners
or stakeholders with long-term alignment with the project's goals.
○ Ecosystem Fund: 8.5% is set aside for the ecosystem fund, which is probably used to
further the development and growth of the Shrapnel ecosystem.
○ Market Making and Liquidity: 3% is dedicated to market making and liquidity, ensuring
stability and fluidity in the token's trading on exchanges.
○ Public Distribution: A relatively small portion, 1.5%, is allocated for public distribution,
which might include airdrops, public sales, or other forms of distribution to the broader
public.
● Shrapnel’s Game Tweaks Token Schedule with 75% Less SHRAP Unlocking in April
○ According to Champ, an advisor for Shrapnel, “The new SHRAP unlock schedule
positions the product teams to pursue that ambition fully. We see longevity in the
project and its economy and fully support this road to sustainability for the SHRAP
token.”
Player Progression and Community Engagement

● Three Layers:
○ Gameplay Fundamentals: Shrapnel is a strategic game set in a post-apocalyptic world
where players gather resources to build bases and armies, launch attacks to acquire
resources from others and grow their empires. Strategic thinking is required for combat
and forming alliances and trading with other players, contributing to a dynamic and
evolving in-game economy.
○ NFT Exchange: The game features a robust NFT marketplace where players can
securely purchase and trade NFTs representing in-game items such as armor and
weapons. These NFTs are more than cosmetic; they confer actual gameplay
advantages, like boosting resource output or increasing combat damage.
○ Governance Token (SHRP): SHRP tokens allow players to participate in the game's
governance, giving them a say in its development and rewarding them for their
involvement. Beyond governance, SHRP tokens have tangible value within the game’s
economy, as they can be earned through gameplay and then traded for other
cryptocurrencies or fiat money, offering real-world value.
● Shrapnel's player progression metrics suggest a well-balanced game difficulty, with users
achieving levels, completing missions, and unlocking achievements.
● The community engagement outside the game environment, such as on social media or
forums, is a testament to the game's ability to create a robust and loyal community.
● However, Shrapnel has to deal with increasing numbers of cheaters and players who utilize
unfair advantages, which harms the community.
Network and Blockchain Metrics
● The game leverages blockchain technology, ensuring transaction speeds, low gas fees, and
innovative contract activity that contribute to a positive user experience.
● The integration of GameBridge, a Web3 API, enables players to disassemble and sell individual
objects, enhancing the ownership experience.
Technology and Innovation
● The Unreal 5 engine underpins the gaming experience, offering cutting-edge graphics and
immersive gameplay.
● Shrapnel's use of NFTs and blockchain technology ensures that players genuinely own their
in-game assets, promoting a player-driven in-game economy.
